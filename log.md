# Project Log

## 2024-03-02

### Project Exploration
- Explored the project structure to understand the codebase organization
- Generated a tree structure of the codebase to visualize the project hierarchy
- Identified the main components: Core, CLI, and Test projects

### Project Structure
The project follows a standard .NET solution structure with multiple projects:
- TimesheetCli.Core: Contains the business logic, database context, and entity models
- TimesheetCli.Cli: Contains the command-line interface implementation
- TimesheetCli.Test: Contains unit tests for the application

The Core project is further organized into:
- Db: Contains database-related code including the ApplicationDbContext
- Services: Will contain service implementations for business logic

This structure follows good separation of concerns principles, separating the core business logic from the presentation layer (CLI).
